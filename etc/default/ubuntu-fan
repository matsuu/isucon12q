# Configuration for Ubuntu fan overlay network
#

# FAN_OVERLAY defines the /8 network that is the overlay network.
# It is supplied in the format "250.0.0.0/8".  Note that the /8 specified
# will, if a routable destination, be superseded by the fan overlay.
#
# If this is not set, the fan will not be configured.
#
#FAN_OVERLAY="250.0.0.0/8"

# Use a bridge specifically for the fan overlay.  May be set to false
# to use a pre-existing bridge, e.g., one provided by lxc.  In that case,
# the bridge must be configured for use with fan.
#
USE_FAN_BRIDGE="true"

# Name of the fan bridge, if USE_FAN_BRIDGE is set to true.
# Note if you change the bridge name you need to 
# hange /etc/dnsmasq.d/ubuntu-fan to match.
#
FAN_BRIDGE="fanbr0"

# The network interface to utilize for the fan overlay traffic.  If
# not specified here, the interface associated with the default
# route is chosen.
#
#FAN_PRIMARY="eth0"

# FAN_PRIMARY_ADDR contains the IPv4 address on the FAN_PRIMARY
# interface to use for the fan.
#
# If this is not specified, the first IPv4 address assigned to the
# FAN_PRIMARY interface is utilized.  FAN_PRIMARY_ADDR is specified
# as an IPv4 address without a network mask specifier.
#
# It is expected that this address will be part of a /16 subnet to
# be utilized for the fan underlay.
#
#FAN_PRIMARY_ADDR="10.2.3.4"

# Name of the tunnel device used for fan traffic
#
FAN_DEV="fan0"
