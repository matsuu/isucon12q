# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUs on SMP systems.  The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds.  This is the environment file that is specified to systemd via the
# EnvironmentFile key in the service unit file (or via whatever method the init
# system you're using has).

#
# IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT
#    After starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
#    load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
#    it again.
#
#IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT=

#
# IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS
#    64 bit bitmask which allows you to indicate which CPUs should
#    be skipped when reblancing IRQs.  CPU numbers which have their
#    corresponding bits set to one in this mask will not have any
#    IRQs assigned to them on rebalance.
#
#IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=

#
# IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPULIST
#    The CPUs list which allows you to indicate which CPUs should
#    be skipped when reblancing IRQs. CPU numbers in CPUs list will
#    not have any IRQs assigned to them on rebalance.
#
#      The format of CPUs list is:
#        <cpu number>,...,<cpu number>
#      or a range:
#        <cpu number>-<cpu number>
#      or a mixture:
#        <cpu number>,...,<cpu number>-<cpu number>

# IRQBALANCE_ARGS
#    Append any args here to the irqbalance daemon as documented in the man
#    page.
