# List of LVMed iSCSI Volume Groups.
# Multiple Volume Groups can be specified with spaces
#
# This list defines the Volume Groups that should be activated at boot
# after iSCSI has been activated. If you use dynamic activation of LVM
# volumes (lvmetad), you can (and should) leave this empty.
#
# On shutdown, this setting typically has no effect, since open-iscsi
# tries to determine all active VGs on iSCSI and deactivate them.
# However, if you have a really complicated stacking setup that isn't
# automatically detected, volume groups defined here will also be
# deactivated.
#
# To see whether open-iscsi is able to properly detect your setup for
# shutdown, execute the following on a running system:
#    /lib/open-iscsi/umountiscsi.sh --dry-run
# This will tell you what steps will betaken at shutdown before logging
# out of the iSCSI session.
LVMGROUPS=""


# Handle _netdev devices
# You can specify your iSCSI (LVMed or Multipathed or DM Encrypted)
# devices with the _netdev mount option and open-iscsi will treat them
# accordingly.
#
# Note: however, handling _netdev devices comes with the caveat that
# other _netdev mounts, like an NFS share, also get pulled in with it.
#
# If this option is set to 0, no iSCSI mounts in /etc/fstab will be
# automatically mounted on systems running sysvinit. This setting is
# not necessary when using systemd as init system (Debian's default).
HANDLE_NETDEV=1


# Additional mounts to exclude at shutdown.
#
# If you have additional mounts on iSCSI that shouldn't be umounted at
# shutdown by open-iscsi (by default, open-iscsi excludes / and on
# systemd systems als /usr), place them here. iSCSI sessions that carry
# these mounts will also be kept open.
#
# If any of these mountpoints contain spaces, please use the same
# escaping as in /etc/fstab, i.e. replace the spaces with \040.
EXCLUDE_MOUNTS_AT_SHUTDOWN=""



# Don't logout from ANY iSCSI session on shutdown
#
# When shutting down, if the root filesystem is on iSCSI, open-iscsi
# tries to determine which sessions are still required for the root
# filesystem. By default, the host will still logout from all other
# sessions.
#
# If you are running a very complicated setup of your root filesystem
# (multiple mapping levels stacked on top of each other), it may be the
# case that the autodetection logic doesn't work propery. You may then
# enable this setting to keep around all iSCSI sessions.
#
# Note that /etc/iscsi/iscsi.initramfs must exist for this option to
# have any effect at all.
#
# This was the default behavior in previous versions of this package
# up to the version that shipped with Debian 8 (Jessie).
