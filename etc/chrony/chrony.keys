# This file is solely used for NTP authentication with symmetric keys

# It can contain ID/key pairs which can be generated using the “keygen” option
# from “chronyc”; for example:
# chronyc keygen 1 SHA256 256 >> /etc/chrony/chrony.keys
# would generate a 256-bit SHA-256 key using ID 1.
#
# A list of supported hash functions and output encoding is available by
# consulting the "keyfile" directive in the chrony.conf(5) man page.
