Files found under the /etc/chrony/conf.d directory with the .conf suffix are
parsed in the lexicographical order of the file names when chronyd starts up.
This enables a fragmented configuration of chronyd.

Although those files can contain any directives listed in chrony.conf(5),
it would be wiser to add NTP sources in the /etc/chrony/sources.d
directory. Please read /etc/chrony/sources.d/README for more information.
